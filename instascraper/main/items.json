Where did the time go? I\u2019ll tell you. A lot of working and no sleep. June 6th marks the day that 3 years ago, I arrived in California after a 3 day solo drive across America to get to LA. I truly like Los Angeles. My only complaint is there is too much sunshine. Every year here, there is more growth and more progress that I can measure against the previous. I\u2019m not wasting time, only getting to achieve my dreams, slowly but surely. Success doesn\u2019t happen overnight. If it did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it cause the foundation wouldn\u2019t be solid enough. Through a lot of dedication and experience, my foundation is rock solid. Those three years were chaotic but I have made my stability with much needed help from friends and mentors along the way. Shout out Vik and Rob, Mom and Dad, Suzie and Andrew, Linda and Daryl, Howie, Nathan and Chad, Aubrey and Johnny-Louise!!! I set out to LA to become a working creative. To write and direct my own feature film before 30 years old. To direct music videos for bands I love. Many other things I can\u2019t say right now but one day SOON I\u2019ll show you all my work. This photo was taken in 2012 in Six Flags Magic Mountain, the first day I set foot in California traveling to it on my own. I am 19 years old who came to California to attend Vidcon for the first time. I would go to visit the next year. Skip a year. Then go my graduation year in 2015 as a last hoorah. The community changed and I had changed. I had bigger goals than YouTube. It was fun. It was punk rock. I met a lot of other cool people but like Will in Good Will Hunting, I\u2019m on to bigger and better things while Ben Affleck is waiting at my door. Can someone call the police, why is Batman knocking at my door??? Do I like them apples???

I am 19 years old who came to California to attend Vidcon for the first time. I would go to visit the next year. Skip a year. Then go my graduation year in 2015 as a last hoorah. The community changed and I had changed. I had bigger goals than YouTube. It was fun. It was punk rock. I met a lot of other cool people but like Will in Good Will Hunting, I\u2019m on to bigger and better things while Ben Affleck is waiting at my door. Can someone call the police, why is Batman knocking at my door??? Do I like them apples??? Any, here\u2019s to 3 years and many more in La La Land!!!\ud83c\udf4e \ud83c\udf4f \ud83c\udf4e #ilovela #sunshineisoverated", "image_description": ["person", "person"], "sentiment": "0.0", "videoURL": ""},
